I am an incoming PhD student at Northeastern University, supervised by Prof. [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io). I am currently a third-year Master's student in the [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm) at Peking University supervised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in the [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/) at Peking University. I was a visiting student at [Yale NLP Lab](http://nlp.cs.yale.edu), supervised by [Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com).

I am interested in the evaluation of NLP and LLMs, and I believe that evaluation has an interdisciplinary nature, including but not limited to human factors, machine learning, and statistics. My work has focused on the evaluation of summarization, generation, and LLMs, exploring various aspects of automatic evaluation, human evaluation, and meta-evaluation. 

I believe that evaluation is crucial in current research. Without a more reliable evaluation mechanism, it is difficult to accurately determine whether an innovation is a genuine advancement or merely an illusion, especially in the context of a large amount of incremental research.
